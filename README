This project implement a Windows service that, upon starting and stopping the service, can start and stop the iSpy application. It has the following features:

- Service start/stop will trigger application start/stop
- On stopping the service, it sends "shutdown" command to iSpy so it's shut down gracefully, e.g., recordings are written properly to the files so they are not corrupted.


Currently it's in alpha phase with the following limitation:

- It doesn't restart iSpy if it crashed or terminated outside of the service
- It starts iSpy only from the default installation path (c:\program files(x86)\ispy\ispy\ispy.exe)


USAGE:
=======
You need to install the service manually. install_svc.bat can do that, but you'll need to change the service's LOG ON account to use yours.
